HstWB Image Setup Readme
------------------------

HstWB Image Setup is a set of scripts to automatically prepare files for self
install and installs UAE and FS-UAE config files in WinUAE and FS-UAE Launcher
to simplify installing and running images.

The scripts are written in both Powershell and Python for cross platform support
of Windows, macOS and Linux and it comes with extra files so they can easily be
run directly from Windows Explorer, macOS Finder and Ubuntu Files.

Self install images comes with following image directories for installation:
- "amigaos": Directory with Amiga OS 3.9 iso, Boing Bag 1 & 2 lha,
  Amiga OS 3.1.4, 3.2 or 3.1 adf files.
- "kickstart": Directory with Kickstart rom files. These are used for running
  emulator and installed for WHDLoad.
- "userpackages": Directory with user packages. Each directory represent a user
  package.

If HstWB Image Setup detects UAE and FS-UAE config files have harddrives
configured for self install, it will detecting and install Amiga OS 3.1 adf and
Kickstart rom files from installed Cloanto Amiga Forever or mounted Cloanto
Amiga Forever cd/dvd-rom or iso.

If Cloanto Amiga Forever is not used, then image directories "amigaos" and
"kickstart" must also be prepared manually by copying files to these directories.
See readme files in image directories for details about files to copy manually.

Files for Amiga OS 3.9, 3.2, 3.1.4 must be manually copied to image directories
"amigaos". See readme files in image directories for details about files to copy
manually.

UAE and FS-UAE config files are prepared by patching harddrive paths to same
path as config files and install UAE and FS-UAE config files in WinUAE and
FS-UAE default configuration directories.

Kickstart rom file in UAE and FS-UAE config files are patched to use Kickstart
3.1.4, 3.2 or 3.1 rom, if they exist in image directory "kickstart". If image
directory "kickstart" doesn't exist, HstWB Image Setup will use installed
Cloanto Amiga Forever or mounted Cloanto Amiga Forever cd/dvd-rom or iso.

Amiga OS 3.9 iso is patched as cd image file in UAE and FS-UAE config files,
if it exists in "amigaos" directory.

For FS-UAE config files, adf files in "amigaos" directory are added as
swappable floppies.
