Amiga OS 3.1.4 Installation help
--------------------------------

Amiga OS 3.1.4 comes with modules disk for all Amiga
models and these contain devices and libraries specific
for each different Amiga models.

Installing modules disks is optional as long as
Kickstart rom 3.1.4 is installed in the Amiga using
this image.

If module disks are installed then this image will
support both Kickstart rom 3.1.4 and 3.1, but will use
chip or fast ram to softkick/load Kickstart rom 3.1.4
into memory.

During Amiga OS installation HstWB Installer will copy
all modules disks from .adf files in AMIGAOSDIR: to
SYS:Modules directory and install modules disk for
selected amiga. This makes it easier to switch the image
between different Amiga models.
