---------------------------

Amiga OS 3.1.4 comes with modules disk for all Amiga
models and these contain devices and libraries specific
different Amiga models.

Installing modules disks is optional and can be skipped.

installed in the Amiga running this image. If module
disks are installed then this image will support both
Kickstart 3.1.4 and 3.1 rom, but will require additional
chip or fast ram to softkick/load Kickstart 3.1.4 rom
into memory.
