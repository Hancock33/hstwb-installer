Kickstart installation help
---------------------------

Kickstart installation shows valid kickstart installations
detected in KICKSTARTDIR: device, which can be installed.
HstWB Installer supports both Cloanto Amiga Forever
kickstart rom files and dumps of original kickstart rom
files.

Kickstart installations are mostly used for running demos
and games from harddrive using WHDLoad. It's recommended
to have at least Kickstart 1.3 (34.5) A500 rom installed
to run most demos and games. Some packages also install
accelerator card tools like BlitzKick or ACATune, which
can utilize maprom functionality to map kickstart rom
files as if the kickstart rom is installed in the Amiga.

The detection process examines file md5 checksums to
identify valid kickstart installations. If Kickstart rom
is encrypted, md5 checksum is calculated from decrypting
Kickstart rom in memory. Kickstart roms will remain
encrypted and will require Cloanto Amiga Forever rom key
is installed.

Each valid Kickstart installations detected in
KICKSTARTDIR: device are listed with 'Kickstart ... rom
file detected'.

Selecting 'Install x Kickstart rom file(s)' will continue
self install.
