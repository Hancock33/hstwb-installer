Amiga OS installation help
--------------------------

Amiga OS installation shows valid Amiga OS installations
detected in AMIGAOSDIR: device, which can be installed.
HstWB Installer supports Amiga OS 3.9, 3.2, 3.1.4 and 3.1.

The detection process supports MD5 only and MD5 + mount
to examine files in AMIGAOSDIR: device to identify valid
Amiga OS installations. MD5 only makes detection faster,
but will only detect valid Amiga OS files using MD5
checksum. MD5 + mount makes detection slower, but will use
both MD5 checksum and mount adf for a more broad detection
of valid Amiga OS files.

The detection process mounts iso and adf files requires
that AMIGAOSDIR: device is added with read/write
permissions. This is required by filedisk.device used to
mount files and can also cause these files to be locked
on the host Windows, macOS or Linux environment when
running self install through an emulator. If any locked
files needs to be moved or renamed, then please close and
restart emulator.

Each valid Amiga OS installations detected in AMIGAOSDIR:
device are listed with 'Install Amiga OS ...'.

Selecting an Amiga OS installation to install will continue
self install.
