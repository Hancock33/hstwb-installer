Amiga OS installation help
--------------------------

Amiga OS installation shows valid Amiga OS installations
detected in AMIGAOSDIR: device, which can be installed.
HstWB Installer supports Amiga OS 3.9, 3.2, 3.1.4 and 3.1.

The detection process examines file names and md5
checksums to identify valid Amiga OS installations.
Each detected Amiga OS installation is indicated by
"Install" or "Skip" and the highest version of Amiga OS
detected is selected by default. The Amiga OS installations
that wasn't detected are indicated with "N/A" for not
available.

It's only possible to select one Amiga OS installation
to install, so selecting another Amiga OS installation
than currently selected will automatically deselect the
previous selected Amiga OS Installation changing it from
"Install" to "Skip".

The detection process mounts iso and adf files requires
that AMIGAOSDIR: device is added with read/write
permissions. This is required by filedisk.device used to
mount files and can also cause these files to be locked
on the host Windows, macOS or Linux environment when
running self install through an emulator. If any locked
needs to be moved or renamed, then please close and
restart emulator.

When correct Amiga OS installation is selected, then select
"Continue with Amiga OS ..." to continue self install.
