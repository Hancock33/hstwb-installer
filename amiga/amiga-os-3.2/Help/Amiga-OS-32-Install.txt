Amiga OS 3.2 Install
--------------------

Amiga OS 3.2 comes with modules disk for all Amiga
models and these contain devices and libraries specific
different Amiga models.

Installing modules disks is optional as long as
Kickstart rom 3.2 is installed in the Amiga using
this image.

HstWB Installer will copy all modules disks from .adf
files present in AMIGAOSDIR: to Modules directory and
install selected modules disk. This makes it easier to
switch the image between different Amiga models.
