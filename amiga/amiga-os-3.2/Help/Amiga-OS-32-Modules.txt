Amiga OS 3.2 Modules
--------------------

Amiga OS 3.2 comes with a colorful and professionally
designed icon set called Glow Icons.

Glow Icons works best with a plain Amiga OS 3.2
installation without any Workbench enhancement packages
like ClassicWB, BestWB, BetterWB or HstWB as they will
overwrite icons with their own icon set.

Select "Yes" to install Glow Icons, if installing a
plain Amiga OS 3.2 without any Workbench enhancement
packages. Before installing, a backup of old icons is
first created. Note that Glow Icons might be overwritten,
if installing any packages.

Select "No" to install Glow Icons, if installing
Workbench enhancement packages like ClassicWB, BestWB,
BetterWB or HstWB.

Regardless of choice, Glow Icons can be installed
later by opening Workbench, Icons drawer and 
double-click "Install-GlowIcons". Before installing,
a backup of old icons is first created, which can be
restored by double-clicking "Restore-OldIcons".


Screenmode
----------

Glow Icons looks best with interlaced screenmode, so
it's recommended to update screenmode to interlaced.

Select "Yes" to update screenmode for optimal interlaced
screenmode with Glow Icons. Note screenmode might be
overwritten, if installing any packages.

Select "No" to update screenmode for keeping non
interlaced screenmode.
